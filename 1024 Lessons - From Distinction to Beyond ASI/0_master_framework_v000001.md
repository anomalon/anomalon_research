## The Thread

Every volume connects back to the triangle:

- **Vol I:** The triangle IS the atom of geometry
- **Vol II:** Quantum states live on the Bloch sphere = triangle on a sphere
- **Vol III:** Spacetime is triangulated (Regge calculus)
- **Vol IV:** Computation is built on Boolean logic = 2-simplex decisions
- **Vol V:** Cohomology = the obstruction theory of triangulated spaces
- **Vol VI:** Phase transitions = topology changes in simplicial order
- **Vol VII:** Gauge fields = connections on simplicial bundles
- **Vol VIII:** Constants set the scale of triangles
- **Vol IX:** Molecular geometry = triangulated bonding networks
- **Vol X:** Evolution on fitness landscapes = simplicial complexes
- **Vol XI:** Networks are graphs; rigidity requires triangulation
- **Vol XII:** Neural networks = weighted simplicial complexes
- **Vol XIII:** Consciousness = H¹ obstruction of the neural presheaf
- **Vol XIV:** Hard questions = the boundary of what triangles can compute
- **Vol XV:** Engineering = building what triangles design
- **Vol XVI:** The triangle contains its own theory. The theory contains its own proof. The proof contains the student. The student is the triangle.
