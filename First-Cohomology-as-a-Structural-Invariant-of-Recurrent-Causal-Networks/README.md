The dirty of it is, the engine I use to build my systems, I'm not going to put it out here on a public system, but I will share the code when I am able. 
If there's any code that you want to see that isn't in this folder, please find my email. Let me know. I'm open to giving anybody any information or data they want. 
Nothing here to hide except stupidity but that's pretty obvious from the get-go. Thank you!
