The dirty of it is, the engine I use to build my systems, I'm not going to put it out here on a private public system but I will share the code. 
If there's any code that you like to see that isn't in this folder, please find my email. Let me know; I'm open to giving anybody any information or data they want. 
Nothing here to hide except stupidity but that's pretty obvious from the get-go. Thank you!
